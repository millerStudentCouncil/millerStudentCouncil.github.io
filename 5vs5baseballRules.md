# 5 vs 5 Baseball

## Basic Rules

* Each team pitches to their own teammates, underhand toss as in softball.
* Each batter must keep both hands on the bat while swinging. They are allowed up to 4 tries (4 balls pitched to them) to hit the ball. If a ball is hit foul on the 4th try, the batter is allowed to receive one more pitch.    
* The ball must be hit past the bucket (line from 1st base->bucket-> 3rd base) and within the sidelines to be considered a fair ball.    
* After hitting the ball, the batters run around the bases as in regular baseball. When the ball is placed in the bucket, players already on base may not run any farther. If the batter is running to first and the ball is placed in the bucket before the runner gets to first, the runner is out. All other runners are “frozen” and may not advance any farther.
* A double play may be made when the fielder gets the ball and steps on a base before the runner arrives, and then throws the ball in the bucket before the batter arrives to first base.    
* Runs are scored as in regular baseball. But when one team makes 5 runs in one inning, the batting for that team ends for that inning.    
* If a fielder catches the ball in the outfield where it would normally be considered a home run, it will still count as an out.
* Any fly ball that is caught is an out. Runners can not get out nor can they go further than 1 base until the ball has landed.
* Each team bats until there are 3 outs or until the batting team makes 5 runs.
