#Pennywars will be from May 15-May 26 and is a grae competition.
#Penny Wars is a global project for the Children’s Cancer Recovery Foundation and Free the Children, to help raise awareness and money for unprivileged kids in other countries. 
##There will be three jars (one for each grade) for people to donate in. Coins are positive points and bills are negative points. 
##Nickels are 5 points, dimes are 10 points, one dollar bills are negative 100 points, and so on. You want to put coins (positive points) in your grade level box. You want to put bills (negative points) in the other two grade levels’ boxes. We will give a weekly report on how each grade is doing through the announcements and a whiteboard in the Quad. At the end of each week, Leadership will count up how many points each grade has. Our goal this year is to raise at least $2,000. Money will be donated to the Children’s Cancer Recovery Foundation and Free the Children.
#The Winning Grade Will Recieve Doughnuts
