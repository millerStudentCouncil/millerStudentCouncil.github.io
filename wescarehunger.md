<h4 style="color:cyan">_What is We Are Silent?_
#### We Are Silent is an initiative of Free The Children to ensure all voices are heard around the world. Some of those voices that are not heard include children who are being bullied, denied, or exploited their basic rights. We Are Silent allows all of us to take a stand for the children around the world who donâ€™t have a voice.  All donations go to Free the Children, an organization working to better the lives of children around the world. 

<h4 style="color:cyan">_How do I participate?_
#### You can do your part by taking a Vow of Silence on April 23! Pledge to stay silent for as many hours as you would like. It is completely optional to collect pledges, but remember that all donations will be supporting Free the Children. If you would like to help raise money, you can fill out a pledge form (more information below). Whether you choose to raise money or not, you can obtain We Are Silent stickers from the office anytime from April 20-April 23. 
#### You can also collect pledges online. To do so, go to tinyurl.com/WeAreSilentRegistration and select "Join a Team". To find Miller's team, search "Miller Middle School" in Team Name and click on Search; then click the only option that comes up. After you join the team, you can register on your own and begin collecting pledges online.

<h4 style="color:cyan">_How do I fill out the pledge form?_
#### Start by obtaining a pledge form. You can print one using the link at the bottom of this page. Alternatively, pledge forms will be located at the office from April 8-April 23. Once you have a form, start to find sponsors. Some good examples of sponsors would be your parents, relatives, or friends. Explain why you are pledging silent, and request them to support you by donating. They can donate a certain amount of money for each hour you pledge to stay silent (ex. $5 per hour). Record all this information on your pledge form. Continue collecting as many pledged as possible up till April 23. Once the event is over, record how many hours you have stayed silent. Go back to your sponsors, tell them how long you stayed silent, and request their promised donation (ex. If your parents said they would give you $5 for every hour you stayed silent, and you stayed silent for 8 hours, they would donate $40). Make sure to be polite when requesting donations, and remind your sponsors that their money is going to a great cause. Collect the money (if check, make sure the check is payable to Free the Children) from your sponsors and make sure to turn it into the office or to your homeroom rep by May 1st.

<h4 style="color:cyan">_Do I get any rewards for my efforts?_
#### The biggest reward should be knowing that you have helped children around the world in need! However, there are also some other rewards for your homeroom when you participate. Each person that participates in your homeroom will earn your homeroom class homeroom points! 3 points will be given for each student that pledges silent but does not collect any donations. 5 points will be given to each student who collects any amount of donation. 10 points will be given to each student who collects more than $30 in donations. In addition, you should encourage your homeroom class to participate, because the highest participating homeroom, homeroom with most hours silent, and homeroom with most money raised will receive donuts.
