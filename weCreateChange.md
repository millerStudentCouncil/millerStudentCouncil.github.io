A project hosted my Free the Children to help build schools globally.
**$20= 1 brick and 500 bricks builds a school**

We will be participating in We Create Change from **April 28th-May 15th**, and our **school goal is $5000**.

You can turn in your change to your homeroom box. 

- ###Prizes!!!!
If you get in the top three homerooms who earned the most, you will get a chance to win either a **yogurtland party, icecream party, or a jamba juice party**!
If the school meets our goal ($5000), then we will have a **10 minute extended lunch**!
If you collect $20, you will get 1 homeroom point. If you collect another $20, you will get 2 more homeroom points. If you collect another $20, you will get 3 more homeroom points and so on. For example, collect $60, you will get 6 homeroom points.
