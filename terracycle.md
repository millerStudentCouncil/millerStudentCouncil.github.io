# TERROR Cycling!

## What is TERROR Cycling?
This is the first drive for TerraCycling, a company that takes un-recyclable trash and creates consumer products from them. They take trash and make things like pouches and bags out of them!

## What do we get?
We make money when we send in these wrappers! For every $500 we earn, the following dance will have extra features!

## Great! How can I help?
Bring individual candy packs and giant multi-pack bags and turn them in at the main office and by the student store. DO NOT store them in your homeroom class. Bring them to the collection boxes labeled "TerraCycle Boxes".
