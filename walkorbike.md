#Walk Or Bike To School Day is October 11th!

###Rules:
>### - Walk or Bike to School Day is on Wednesday, October 11th, the Green Day of the Homeroom Competition. Students and teachers will walk or bike to school or back. You will receive homeroom points for this, so remember do it for the environment and for your homeroom! 

>### - If you happen to live far away, you may have your parent/driver/guardian etc. drop you at one of the following four locations nearest to you; Calabazas Park 0.7 miles, Johnson Avenue and Prospect Road 0.7 miles, Johnson Avenue and Tompkins Drive 0.8 miles, or Miller Avenue and Hyde Avenue 0.7 miles. Students are encouraged to walk or bike with friends. If you already walk or bike to school, thatâ€™s great!

>### - Also please remember to turn in the forms when submissions are due, so the homeroom representative will be able to turn in the forms. An email should've been sent to you about the forms. Please contact Tanush Goel if you have any questions.

>### - Please remember to fill out the class participation form after the event.
