# About Spirit Weeks
##
### Spirit weeks are new to the 2017-18 year. Instead of the traditional spirit days, we have a whole WEEK based on a theme.
### On the Tuesday of that week, there is a teacher competition to get teachers involved in spirit weeks.
### On the Thursday of that week, there is a traditional student competition related to the theme.
### However, on the Friday of that week, there is a new type of competition where students and teachers work together in a student-teacher competition! This is where students and teachers work together to earn their homeroom points.
### Every day of the week is still a spirit day, but there are three competitions throughout the week related to the theme.
### We hope you all participate and have fun!
