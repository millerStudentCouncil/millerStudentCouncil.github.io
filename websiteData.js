				"text": "Minecraft is a multiplayer game about placing blocks in a 3-D environment, includes modifications (known as “mods”) written in Java that can alter the game. This session will share how I taught my son to build a mod. I'll share some tips on getting started with modding. I will also share how he got started with Scratch and Greenfoot which helped him pick up Java concepts easily. You will will learn a path that can be followed to start programming in Java, that you can enjoy and proudly share with friends. I'll also share information about upcoming workshops."
