### What is We Are Silent?
We Are Silent is an initiative of Free The Children to ensure all voices are heard around the world. Some of those voices that are not heard include child who are bullied, denied, or exploited their rights. We must do something about this, and We Are Silent does just that. By collecting donations and pledging silent, you can empower your peers around the world.

### How do I participate?
You can collect donations for every hour, minute, or second you are silent on April 10th. For example, you can tell your parents about We Are Silent and you can have them donate $5 for every hour you are silent. If you are silent for three hours on April 10th, they can donate $15. The more sponsors you obtain, the more donations you will get, so start collecting pledges! You can obtain stickers to stay silent for the event next to the student store on April 10th. Donation pledge forms are located at the office, and can also be obtained above. They are due to the office by April 23rd. Free The Children can issue tax receipts for any donations over $10. You can also make donations for Miller at our [Online Donation Page](http://tinyurl.com/wearesilentmiller)

**Remember:** It is the studentâ€™s responsibility to check with their teachers if they can stay silent during April 10th.
