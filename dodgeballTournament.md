# Dodgeball Tournament Information
## Rules
### THE GAME

The object of the game is to eliminate as many of the opposing players by getting them "OUT". This may be done by:
1. Hitting an opposing player with a LIVE thrown ball below the shoulders.
2. Catching a LIVE ball thrown by your opponent before it touches the ground.
 
*Definition: LIVE - A ball that has been thrown and has not touched anything, including the floor/ground, another ball, another player, official or other item outside of the playing field (wall, ceiling, etc)*
 
### BOUNDARIES

During play, all players must remain within the boundary lines. Players may leave the boundaries through their end-line only to retrieve stray balls. They must also return through their end-line.
The end line- is the back of the gym (by the black colored cushions)

### THE OPENING RUSH
Game begins by placing the dodgeballs along the center line – three (3) on one side of the center hash and three (3) on the other. Players then take a position behind their end line. Following a signal by the official, teams may approach the centerline to retrieve the balls. This signal officially starts the contest. Teams may only retrieve the three (3) balls to their right of the center hash. Once a ball is retrieved it must be taken behind the attack-line before it can be legally thrown.
 
### TIMING AND WINNING A GAME
The team to legally eliminate as many opposing players will be declared the winner. A 1-minute or 30 second time limit has been established for each contest. If both teams still have the same amount of people left on each side, then the remaining players from each team will have a showdown. The games will be best out of 3.
Showdown- the first team who legally get someone from the opposing team out will win.
The finals will each last 1 minute.

### TIME-OUTS & SUBSTITUTIONS
There will be NO time-outs and substitution. If a team has less than 6 people, they will still play.

### 5-SECOND VIOLATION
In order to reduce stalling, a violation will be called if a player holds the ball for more than 5 seconds. If there is to much stalling, the official/referee will shorten the time.
 
### RULE ENFORCEMENT
The court monitor’s responsibility will be to rule on any situation in which teams cannot agree. THE COURT MONITOR’S DECISION IS FINAL – NO EXCEPTIONS.
