#We Are Silent will be on May 18!

##-On May 18th, go silent to raise awareness for the millions of people around the world who are denied their basic rights and ability to make choices for themselves. Together, our silence can help those who are denied a voice. 
		##- Before We Are Silent, you can use #MillerIsSilent2017 (miller is silent 2017) to let your followers know about your upcoming online silence
	##	- Raising money is optional, but encouraged. Pledge forms will be in the office, and are on millersc.org. 
	 ##	- Each student will pick up a Participation Form and fill it out truthfully and honestly the day after the event. 
	##	- Students have until May 22, 2017 to turn the form into the office. Any forms turned in after the 22nd will not be picked up and considered as an on-time form.
