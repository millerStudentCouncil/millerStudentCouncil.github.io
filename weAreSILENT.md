#We Are Silent

###We Are Silent is an opportunity to raise awareness for those whose voices are silenced. To further your impact, you can also raise money through pledges. Ask people to donate money per hour that you are silent, or a flat donation. Print out a Pledge Form, and start collecting! If your sponsors pay by check, the check should be written to Free the Children. Raising money is optional, but remember that all donations go directly to Free the Children. You can also make your silence stronger by staying off of social media. Before the event date, post a message to your followers, letting them know why youâ€™ll be silent on May 4th. Make sure to include #MillerIsSilent2017 (miller is silent 2017).
