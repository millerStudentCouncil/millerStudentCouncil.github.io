#We Are Silent

###What is We Are Silent?
#####We Are Silent is an opportunity to raise awareness for those whose voices are silenced. 
#####To further your impact, you can also raise money through pledges. Ask people to donate money per hour that you are silent, or a flat donation. Print out a Pledge Form (See below or under the Forms tab above for the link), and start collecting! If your sponsors pay by check, the check should be written to Free the Children. 
#####Raising money is optional, but remember that all donations go directly to Free the Children. 
#####You can also make your silence stronger by staying off of social media. Before the event date, post a message to your followers, letting them know why youâ€™ll be silent on April 21. Make sure to include #millerissilent2016 (miller is silent 2016).

###Homeroom Points?
#####For this event, you also have the opportunity to gain homeroom points! For every hour that you are silent on April 21, you will earn one homeroom point for you class. You can also earn a bonus point by staying off social media for the entire day.
####There will also be prizes for homerooms that have the most participation, most hours silent, and the homeroom that raised the most money.
